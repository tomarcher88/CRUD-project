# CRUD Project

To include:

- Calendar
- Todo List
- Gratitude's
- Celebrations

### Takeaways

During this project I learnt a couple of things.

- Context should be used for global variables and not just all parts of a project that are used in multiple places.
- I need to think more about how I can make components as reusable as possible. Ideally with no unique hardcoded elements.
